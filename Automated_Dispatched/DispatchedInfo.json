Whenever a player calls a command for a move, like .pick Fuel for example, that action is added to the turn requests list. 15 seconds after the start of the game, a loop starts wherein, every 5 seconds, one of the turn requests is picked at random and is executed. If 5 people make their moves within the first 15 seconds, for example, a player will have 1/5 chance of having their move request be run first, and then the 4 remaining players, and any player who add their turn request later on, will be waiting in line for their own move request to run.",
